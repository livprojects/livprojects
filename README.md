### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my Github profile ! My name is Liv, I am 27 and I am a junior web developer from France. My technical training has been more focused on Javascript (especially React and Node.js) and Java for now, but I am eager to expand my knowledge. The projects marked with the 🎯 emoji are the ones I would like you to look at in priority. 

📬 Please feel free to reach out and comment on my projects, but please be kind, constructive and bear in mind I am still a junior developer! Thank you ✨ 

📰 I also have a Master's degree in political science which doubles as a professional degree in Journalism. I have been writing for six years now for major French media outlets on economics, science, societal issues and literature. So whether you're interested in my technical or my writing skills, you can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_elleivy), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liv-audigane/) or via email: liv.audigane@gmail.com.

#### 💾 COMPLETE PROJECTS (or will they ever be?)

- __Orizon__ 🔸 HTML, CSS, React/Redux (Javascript), Node.js (Javascript), Express.js, Three.js, PostgreSQL, Sequelize

*Orizon is an informative website (hosted on Heroku) for kids and teenagers aged between 10 and 17 years old, about the upcoming space race. Starting with the Moon, you can browse through all the missions already scheduled.*

> Profile edit still shaky, will be fixed some time soon.

⏯[Repository](https://github.com/livprojects/orizon-prod) | [Hosted on Heroku](https://o-rizon.herokuapp.com/#/) | [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRnSeJcDcPs&feature=youtu.be&t=5041&ab_channel=O%27clock)


- __Quiz (Orizon)__ 🔸 HTML, CSS (SASS), React

*A quiz feature from the [Orizon](https://github.com/livprojects/orizon-prod) group project. I coded this feature myself and switched from a Redux environment (in the Orizon setting) to a slimmer React-only project, just for display purposes. Two quizzes are available for now: for each question, you can choose how many answers you want to click on. There is a confirmation step: green is the right answer, red is a wrong one. If you didn't select the right answer, the quiz won't tell you which it was: it is on purpose. You can click on any of the answers but there is a clue stating how many answers are expected. You get the results at the end of each quiz.*
