### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my Github profile ! My name is Liv, I am 26 and I am a junior web developer from France. My technical training has been more focused on Javascript (especially React and Node) but I am eager to expand my knowledge. 

📬 Please feel free to reach out and comment on my projects, but please be kind, constructive and bear in mind I am still a junior developer! Thank you ✨ 

📰 I also have a Master's degree in political science which doubles as a professional degree in Journalism. I have been writing for six years now for major French media outlets on economics, science, societal issues and literature. So whether you're interested in my technical or my writing skills, you can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_elleivy), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liv-audigane/) or via email: liv.audigane@gmail.com. 

📍 *Tech stack I am ready to use in a professional environment*

- CSS / Sass (SCSS)
- React / Redux
- Node.js
- Express.js
- SQL/PostgreSQL/Sequelize
- RESTful APIs design & implementation

#### 💻 IN PROGRESS (and what's missing)

- __Orizon__ 🔸 HTML, CSS, React/Redux (Javascript), Node.js (Javascript), Express.js, Three.js, PostgreSQL, Sequelize

*Orizon is an informative website for kids and teenagers aged between 10 and 17 years old, about the upcoming space race. Starting with the Moon, you can browse through all the missions already scheduled.*

> Missing: better responsive design, stronger authentication features, possibility to add your own quiz, unit tests, etc.

- __Magic Eight Ball__ 🔸 HTML, CSS (Grid), Javascript vanilla

*Have you ever wanted to know what your fate will be? This is a tribute to magic eight balls.*

🔎 *Passes accessible contrast test (checked with [Deque University's aXe tool](https://dequeuniversity.com/color-contrast))*

> Missing: responsive (add breakpoint to 1200px), rule to check empty input/without a question mark

⏯[Repository](https://github.com/livprojects/MagicEightBall) / [Codepen](https://codepen.io/livprojects/full/abNjeqe)

- __Style Stage__ 🔸 HTML, CSS (SASS)

*An open source CSS project described as 'a modern CSS showcase styled by community contributions". More info [here](https://stylestage.dev/).*

> Missing: pretty much everything

- __Draw your tiles__ 🔸 HTML, CSS, Javascript vanilla

*Click on the tiles to draw whatever you want, thanks to this tool coded in Javascript.*

> Missing: actual drawing feature / possibility to change the size of the grid and each cell

#### 💾 COMPLETE PROJECTS (or will they ever be?)

- __Quiz (Orizon)__ 🔸 HTML, CSS (SASS), React

A quiz feature from the [Orizon](https://github.com/livprojects/orizon) project. I coded this myself and switched from a Redux environment (in the Orizon setting) to a slimmer React-only project, just for display purposes. Two quizzes are available for now: for each question, you can choose how many answers you want to click on. There is a confirmation step: green is the right answer, red is a wrong one. If you didn't select the right answer, the quiz won't tell you which it was: it is on purpose. You can click on any of the answers but there is a clue stating how many answers are expected. You get the results at the end of each quiz.

- __Mario__ 🔸 C

*With this program written in C for [Harvard's CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2020/fall/) class, you can build half pyramids like in Nintendo's SuperMario Brothers.*

⏯[Repository](https://github.com/livprojects/Mario)

- __Cash__ 🔸 C

*A greedy algorithm written in C for [Harvard's CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2020/fall/) class to determine the least number of coins due when giving change.*

⏯[Repository](https://github.com/livprojects/Cash)

- __Readability__ 🔸 C

*With this program written in C for [Harvard's CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2020/fall/) class, you can determine the approximate grade level needed to understand a specific text.*

⏯[Repository](https://github.com/livprojects/Readability)

- __Dinos on edge__ 🔸 Scratch

*While exploring other ways of coding and teaching kids the basics of algorithms, I coded this game in [MIT's Scratch language](https://scratch.mit.edu/). You are a dinosaur, run to avoid the asteroids falling on Earth!*
