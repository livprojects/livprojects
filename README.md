### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my Github profile ! My name is Liv, I am 26 and I am a junior web developer from France. My technical training has been more focused on Javascript (especially React and Node) but I am eager to expand my knowledge. 

📬 Please feel free to reach out and comment and my projects, but please be kind, constructive and bear in mind I am still a junior developer! Thank you ✨ 

📰 I also have a Master's degree in political science which doubles as a professional degree in Journalism. I have been writing for six years now for major French media outlets on economics, science, societal issues and literature. So whether you're interested in my technical or my writing skills, you can reach me on Twitter, Linkedin or via e-mail.
