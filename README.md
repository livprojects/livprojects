### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my Github profile! My name is Liv, I am 31 and I am a full-stack developer from France. My technical training has been more focused on Javascript (especially React and Node.js) and Java, but I am eager to expand my knowledge. The projects marked with the 🎯 emoji are the ones I would like you to look at in priority. Those are only PRACTICE projects and do not necessarily reflect what I've been doing on a daily basis.

📰 I also have a Master's degree in political science which doubles as a professional degree in Journalism. I have been writing for six years now for major French media outlets on economics, science, societal issues and literature. So whether you're interested in my technical or my writing skills, you can reach me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liv-audigane/).

#### 💾 COMPLETE PROJECTS (or will they ever be?)

- __Portfolio__ 🔸 HTML, CSS, React (Javascript)

*This portfolio was deployed in January 2023 and acts as a showcase for my career as a journalist and then a full-stack developer. It was coded in React.*

- __Orizon__ 🔸 HTML, CSS, React/Redux (Javascript), Node.js (Javascript), Express.js, Three.js, PostgreSQL, Sequelize

*Group project: Orizon is an informative website (hosted on Heroku) for kids and teenagers aged between 10 and 17 years old, about the upcoming space race. Starting with the Moon, you can browse through all the missions already scheduled.*

- __Quiz (Orizon)__ 🔸 HTML, CSS (SASS), React

*A quiz feature from the [Orizon](https://github.com/livprojects/orizon-prod) group project. I coded this feature myself and switched from a Redux environment (in the Orizon setting) to a slimmer React-only project, just for display purposes. Two quizzes are available for now: for each question, you can choose how many answers you want to click on. There is a confirmation step: green is the right answer, red is a wrong one. If you didn't select the right answer, the quiz won't tell you which it was: it is on purpose. You can click on any of the answers but there is a clue stating how many answers are expected. You get the results at the end of each quiz.*
